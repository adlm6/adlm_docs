Heritability : the ability of a trait to be passed genetically to one\u2019s offspring Criteria Variation in the phenotypes of a population: different phenotypes in a population Traits : (based in the genotype) have to be inheritable Environmental pressure Differential survival based on traits giving some organisms in the population an advantage (traits that give some people advantages) Directional selection: goes to the right or to the left Stabilizing selection: curve goes whoop Disruptive selection: selection away from the mean in both directions Genetic Drift : variations in allele frequency in a population due to chance processes, most prominent in small populations Bottleneck effect: decreased genetic variation in a population due to an event that eliminated a large percentage of a population due to chance (as opposed to naturally selecting individuals) Founder\u2019s effect: when a small group branches off from a population and begins a separate population that is genetically representative of the \u201cfounders\u201d but not necessarily the ancestral population as a whole Ancestral population: the population from which an organism descended Gene flow: when members of a previously separate population join and interbreed with a new population, altering the existing genetic makeup of the population Mutation : a chance event in which an allele is altered at birth, resulting in a previously unknown allele to the population Non-random mating: the process by which organisms choose mates based on some factor Intersexual selection: a process in which organisms of the opposite sex discriminate between mating partners based on observable characteristics that generally display fitness of some sort Fitness : survival and reproductive success Intrasexual selection: competition between organisms of the same sex (usually males) for limited mating partners, typically involves some display of fitness in the form of physical competition Speciation Speciation : how a new species of animal or plant is created, speciation occurs when one part of a population separates from another, the process by which a population branches into two or more species due to some form of reproductive barrier, macroevolution Allopatric speciation: speciation occurring due to a geographical barrier between two populations, physically preventing them from even being together. Sympatric speciation: speciation that occurs among two populations in close geographical proximity, but a non-geographic reproductive barrier exists preventing them from exchanging genes Polyploid speciation: The condition in which a normally diploid cell or organism acquires one or more additional sets of chromosomes. Species Concepts Biological species concept: a species is a population of organisms that under natural conditions are able to mate and produce fertile offspring, a group of individuals that have the potential to mate in nature and produce viable, fertile offspring (members of a species can potentially interbreed and produce fertile offspring) Morphological species concept: a group of individuals that have similar features and/or structures Phylogenetic species concept: the smallest group of individuals that share a common ancestor and form one branch on the tree of life Ecological species concept: a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment Genetics Gene : a section of DNA that codes for a protein that influences a specific trait (like eye color gene) Allele : a variant of a gene (like blue (b) or brown (B) eye color genes) Genotype : the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a specific gene, organisms commonly have two alleles of each gene, one from each parent (like having two brown eye alleles, BB) Phenotype : the observed trait resulting from having a specific genotype (physical, like having brown eyes) Barriers Prezygotic barrier: a barrier that prevents two organisms in an environment from mating successfully Habitat barrier: two organisms that live in the same region but occupy different habitats (i.e. the canopy of a tree vs. the brush below) Mechanical barrier: two organisms do not have compatible reproductive organs Gametic barrier: the gametes (sperm and egg cells) of two organisms are incompatible Behavioral isolation: two organisms do not recognize each other as potential mates Temporal isolation: two organisms have different mating seasons Postzygotic barrier: a barrier that prevents two organisms from producing fertile offspring even though mating may occur, commonly the result of hybridization between species Miscellaneous Vocabulary Population : a group of organisms of one species that interbreed and live in the same place at the same time Adaptive radiation : occurs when a species gives rise to many new species after colonizing a region with diverse habitats, evolution of many diverse species from a common ancestor, previous mass extinctions give new species through founder effect to have no competition.
